        <p>I have only been coding for the last few weeks, if it wasn't already painfully obvious. I became intersted in this field because it allows for a person to identify and solve ever changing problems in a logical and hopefully efficient way. I am not there yet. Being my first webpage, I have faced many new and difficult roadblocks. With counless hours spent looking for solutions I have found some help in identifying the issues, but it will be time and only time that will allow me to move effortlessly through complicated code. As frustrating as it all has been, it has also been immensley enjoyable and rewarding. I will enjoy looking back at pointers and finding new resources to help me better my code writing skills. Oh well, I tried.</p>
